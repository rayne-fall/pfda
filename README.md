This repository contains work related to ATU Programming for Data Analytics - Autumn 2024. The code is written in Python, meaning you'll need to have Python installed to run it. I've used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) as the installer, with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the code editor, but you can use whatever you prefer.
