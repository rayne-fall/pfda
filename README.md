This repository contains work related to ATU Programming for Data Analytics - Autumn 2024. The code is written in Python, meaning you'll need to have Python installed to run it. I've used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) as the installer, with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the code editor, but you can use whatever you prefer. 

The assignments folder contains three Jupyter notebooks and a Python script. 

assignment2-weather.ipynb takes a CSV file provided in the PFDA-courseware repository and contains a plot charting the change in temperature of the dry bulbs over time. 

assignment03-pie.ipynb contains a pie chart showing the different email domains in a provided CSV file. 

assignment_5_risk.py simulates the game Risk, pitting two armies against each other until one army runs out of troops. The size of each army is decided by the user, and the program outputs a pie chart showing the number of rounds won by each side once the simulation has finished.

assignment_6_Weather.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook analysing weather data between 10 April 1996 and 1 December 2024. Specifically, the notebook contains seven plots related to windspeed and temperature:
1. Temperature changes over time.
1. Mean temperature per day.
1. Mean temperature per month.
1. Windspeed changes over time.
1. Windspeed changes over 24 hours.
1. Maximum windspeed for each day.
1. Monthly mean of daily max windspeeds.
